class ReliableChannel;

/// Performs datagram sequencing, packet fragmentation and reassembly.  Works with Bitstream to provide methods to send and
/// receive data over UDP with varying reliability and latency characteristics.  To use, create a DatagramSequencer with the
/// fixed-size header that will be included with all outgoing datagrams and expected in all incoming ones (the contents of the
/// header are not checked on receive, only skipped over, and may be modified by the party that actually send the
/// datagram--this means that the header may include dynamically generated data, as long as its size remains fixed).  Connect
/// the readyToWrite signal to a slot that will actually transmit the datagram to the remote party.  When a datagram is
/// received from that party, call receivedDatagram with its contents.
///
/// A "packet" represents a batch of data sent at one time (split into one or more datagrams sized below the MTU).  Packets are
/// received in full and in order or not at all (that is, a packet being assembled is dropped as soon as a fragment from the
/// next packet is received).  Packets can be any size, but the larger a packet is, the more likely it is to be dropped--so,
/// it's better to keep packet sizes close to the MTU.  To write a packet, call startPacket, write data to the returned
/// Bitstream, then call endPacket (which will result in one or more firings of readyToWrite).  Data written in this way is not
/// guaranteed to be received, but if it is received, it will arrive in order.  This is a good way to transmit delta state:
/// state that represents the change between the last acknowledged state and the current state (which, if not received, will
/// not be resent as-is; instead, it will be replaced by up-to-date new deltas).
///
/// There are two methods for sending reliable data.  The first, for small messages that require minimum-latency processing, is
/// the high priority messaging system.  When you call sendHighPriorityMessage, the message that you send will be included with
/// every outgoing packet until it is acknowledged.  When the receiving party first sees the message, it will fire a
/// receivedHighPriorityMessage signal.
///
/// The second method employs a set of independent reliable channels multiplexed onto the packet stream.  These channels are
/// created lazily through the getReliableOutputChannel/getReliableInputChannel functions.  Output channels contain buffers
/// to which one may write either arbitrary data (as a QIODevice) or messages (as QVariants), or switch between the two.
/// Each time a packet is sent, data pending for reliable output channels is added, in proportion to their relative priorities,
/// until the packet size limit set by setMaxPacketSize is reached.  On the receive side, the streams are reconstructed and
/// (again, depending on whether messages are enabled) either the QIODevice reports that data is available, or, when a complete
/// message is decoded, the receivedMessage signal is fired.
