// The VerletCapsuleShape is similar to a regular CapsuleShape, except it keeps a pointer
// to its endpoints which are owned by some other data structure (a verlet simulation system).  
// This makes it easier for the points to be moved around by constraints in the system
// as well as collisions with the shape, however it has some drawbacks:
//
// (1) The Shape::_translation and ::_rotation data members are not used (wasted)
//
// (2) A VerletShape doesn't own the points that it uses, so you must be careful not to
//     leave dangling pointers around.
//
// (3) Some const methods of VerletCapsuleShape are much more expensive than you might think.
//     For example getHalfHeight() and setHalfHeight() methods must do extra computation.  In
//     particular setRotation() is significantly more expensive than for the CapsuleShape.
//     Not too expensive to use when setting up shapes, but you woudln't want to use it deep
//     down in a hot simulation loop, such as when processing collision results.  Best to
//     just let the verlet simulation do its thing and not try to constantly force a rotation.
